# Graph animation

This is my student project for a python programming course at SPbSTU.
The task is to make a visuaization of two graph search algorithms (depth-first and breadth-first), using any graph visualization library. I have chosen networkx, since it allowes to draw graphs inside given matplotlib axes. That enables me to create animation right inside the program and output is as .gif file.

## Installation
